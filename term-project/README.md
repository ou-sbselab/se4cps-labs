INSTRUCTIONS
---

Consider this document your submission guide for the whole project.  I have setup a folder structure to make it easy to submit your assignments to the GitHub classroom.

Follow the instructions below for putting files in the appropriate places.

When you are ready to check in your project (you should be able to check in multiple times), from the root of this directory (i.e., ./term-project), run the following:

    $ git add *

    $ git commit -m "<NOTE DESCRIBING THIS CHECK IN>"

    $ git push

You may need to run `sudo` for some of those commands as well (if you get a permisison error).

ARTIFACT INSTRUCTIONS
---

If you have any models or figures that you used for your SE process, place them in the doc directory.  Also, put your term project slides in the doc directory as well.

SOURCE INSTRUCTIONS
---

All code should be placed in the src directory.  

README.md INSTRUCTIONS
---

Please fill out this README file as appropriate for your project.
Replace ALL text in this document with:

* Your name
* Date
* Project title

Then add paragraphs for:

* Brief overview of your project (what is the CPS and what is the SE technique)
* A HOWTO guide on how to run your project, including what libraries/modules are needed, commands to run the project, etc.
